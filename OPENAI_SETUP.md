# ðŸ¤– OpenAI API Setup (Optional)

## Current Status: AI Features Working in Mock Mode

Your AI features are **already working** with intelligent mock responses! Users can:
- âœ… Get AI resume enhancement suggestions
- âœ… Upload and parse resumes with fallback parsing
- âœ… Generate cover letter variants

## To Enable Full AI Power:

1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Sign up/login to OpenAI
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

### 2. Add to Your Backend
```bash
cd /Users/christopher/Projects/JobLander/backend
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here" >> .env
```

### 3. Restart Backend
```bash
npm run dev
```
