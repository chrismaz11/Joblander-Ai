## 🔧 Configuration Requirements

### Social Login Setup (Final Step)
To complete the social login integration, configure OAuth secrets:

```bash
# Set Google OAuth credentials
npx ampx sandbox secret set GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
npx ampx sandbox secret set GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET

# Set Amazon OAuth credentials  
npx ampx sandbox secret set AMAZON_CLIENT_ID
npx ampx sandbox secret set AMAZON_CLIENT_SECRET
```

### Google OAuth Setup
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create/select project → APIs & Services → Credentials
3. Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID
4. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   - `https://<cognito-domain>/oauth2/idpresponse`
   - `http://localhost:5173/auth/callback`

### Amazon OAuth Setup
1. Go to [Amazon Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/)
2. Login with Amazon → Create Security Profile
3. Add allowed return URLs:
   - `https://<cognito-domain>/oauth2/idpresponse`
   - `http://localhost:5173/auth/callback`

## 🚀 Migration Features Ready

### User Authentication Flow
```
Registration → Email Verification → Profile Setup → Dashboard Access
Social Login → Account Linking → Attribute Mapping → Dashboard Access
```

### Password Management
```
Forgot Password → Email Code → Reset Confirmation → New Password Set
```

### User Profile Management
```
Update Attributes → Validation → Cognito Sync → UI Refresh
```
