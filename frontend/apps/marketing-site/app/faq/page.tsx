    question: "Do I get full access during the $1.99 trial?",

      "Yes. Trials include every Pro feature: unlimited templates, exports, AI suggestions, and analytics. Cancel within 7 days to avoid renewing at $11.99 every 4 weeks.",

    question: "What happens to my resumes if I cancel?",

    question: "How do single export credits work?",
    answer:
      "Credits cost $4.99 and unlock one PDF or DOCX export. You can apply unused credits toward a subscription later with prorated pricing.",

  {
    question: "Which payment methods are supported?",
    answer:
      "Stripe handles card payments, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and regional wallets. Receipts and subscription management flow through the Stripe Customer Portal.",
