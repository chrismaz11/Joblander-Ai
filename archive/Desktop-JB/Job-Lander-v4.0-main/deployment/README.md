- Database restoration
- Health verification
- Dry-run capability

#### Usage

```bash
# Basic rollback to most recent backup
npx tsx deployment/scripts/rollback.ts <environment>

# Rollback to specific deployment
npx tsx deployment/scripts/rollback.ts production --target=1234567890

# With database restoration
npx tsx deployment/scripts/rollback.ts production --restore-db --force

# Dry run (recommended first)
npx tsx deployment/scripts/rollback.ts production --dry-run
```

#### Command Line Options

- `--target=<timestamp>`: Rollback to specific deployment backup
- `--restore-db`: Also restore database from backup
- `--skip-health-checks`: Skip post-rollback health validation
- `--force`: Skip confirmation prompts (required for production)
- `--dry-run`: Show what would be done without making changes

#### Safety Features

- **Production Protection**: Requires `--force` flag for production rollbacks
- **Confirmation Prompts**: Interactive confirmation for destructive operations  
- **Backup Creation**: Creates checkpoint before rollback starts
- **Health Validation**: Verifies application health after rollback
- **Dry Run Mode**: Test rollback process without making changes

## Package.json Scripts

Add these scripts to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy:dev": "tsx deployment/scripts/deploy.ts development",
    "deploy:staging": "tsx deployment/scripts/deploy.ts staging", 
    "deploy:prod": "tsx deployment/scripts/deploy.ts production --force",
    "rollback:dev": "tsx deployment/scripts/rollback.ts development",
    "rollback:staging": "tsx deployment/scripts/rollback.ts staging",
    "rollback:prod": "tsx deployment/scripts/rollback.ts production",
    "build:backend": "tsc --project server/tsconfig.json",
    "db:push": "drizzle-kit push:pg"
  }
}
```

## Deployment Process

### Development Environment

Development deployments are straightforward with minimal safety checks:

```bash
npm run deploy:dev
```

**Features**:
- Basic tests only
- No migration backups
- Relaxed health checks
- Automatic rollback on failure

### Staging Environment  

Staging deployments include production-like safety measures:

```bash
npm run deploy:staging
```

**Features**:
- Full test suite execution
- Database migration testing
- Security scans
- Performance validation
- Health checks
- Slack notifications

### Production Environment

Production deployments require explicit confirmation and include all safety measures:

```bash
npm run deploy:prod
```

**Features**:
- Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, security)
- Database backups before migrations
- Blockchain resource setup
- Full health validation
- Monitoring dashboard updates
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Slack notifications
- Performance metrics

## Rollback Procedures

### When to Rollback

Consider rollback in these scenarios:
- Critical bugs discovered after deployment
- Performance degradation
- Failed health checks
- User-reported issues
- Database corruption

### Rollback Methods

#### 1. Application-Only Rollback

Rolls back application code without affecting database:

```bash
npm run rollback:prod --force
```

**Use when**:
- Application bugs without data changes
- Frontend issues
- Configuration problems

#### 2. Full Rollback with Database

Rolls back both application and database:

```bash
npx tsx deployment/scripts/rollback.ts production --restore-db --force
```

**Use when**:
- Database migration failures
- Data corruption issues
- Schema incompatibilities

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Database rollback overwrites current data

#### 3. Targeted Rollback

Roll back to a specific deployment:

```bash
npx tsx deployment/scripts/rollback.ts production --target=1673640000000 --force
```

**Use when**:
- Need to revert multiple deployments
- Specific known-good state exists
- Surgical precision required

### Rollback Safety

#### Pre-Rollback Checklist

1. **Assess Impact**: Understand what will be reverted
2. **Check Dependencies**: Verify external integrations
3. **Backup Current State**: Script automatically creates checkpoint
4. **Notify Team**: Communicate rollback to stakeholders
5. **Monitor Resources**: Ensure sufficient resources available

#### Production Rollback Process

1. **Dry Run First**:
   ```bash
   npx tsx deployment/scripts/rollback.ts production --dry-run
   ```

2. **Execute Rollback**:
   ```bash
   npx tsx deployment/scripts/rollback.ts production --force
   ```

3. **Verify Success**:
   - Check application health
   - Validate critical user flows
   - Monitor error rates
   - Confirm database integrity

4. **Post-Rollback Actions**:
   - Update monitoring dashboards
   - Notify users (if necessary)
   - Create incident report
   - Plan fix deployment

## Health Checks

Both deployment and rollback scripts include comprehensive health monitoring:

### Application Health Endpoints

Scripts automatically test these endpoints:
- `/api/health` - Basic application health
- `/api/health/db` - Database connectivity
- `/api/admin/llm/health` - AI service health
- `/api/blockchain/health` - Blockchain service health
- `/api/version` - Version information

### Critical User Flows

Automated testing of:
- Homepage accessibility
- API responsiveness
- Authentication flows (in CI/CD)
- Core feature availability

### Health Check Failure Response

If health checks fail:
1. **Development**: Warning logged, deployment continues
2. **Staging**: Deployment fails, automatic rollback triggered
3. **Production**: Deployment fails, automatic rollback triggered

## Monitoring and Alerting

### CloudWatch Metrics

Deployment scripts publish custom metrics:
- `JobLander/Deployments/DeploymentSuccess`
- `JobLander/Deployments/DeploymentDuration` 
- `JobLander/Deployments/RollbackExecuted`

### Slack Notifications

Configure `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` to receive:
- Deployment start/completion notifications
- Rollback alerts
- Health check failures
- Performance warnings

### Log Monitoring

Monitor these log streams:
- Application deployment logs
- Database migration logs
- Health check results
- Error rates and patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "AWS credentials not configured"
```bash
aws configure
# OR
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret
```

#### "Amplify app not found"
```bash
# Verify app ID
aws amplify list-apps
export AMPLIFY_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

#### "Database connection failed"
```bash
# Test database connection
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT version();"
```

#### "Health checks failed"
```bash
# Check application logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/your-function-name
```

### Emergency Procedures

#### Complete Deployment Failure

1. **Stop traffic** (if possible):
   ```bash
   # Update DNS to maintenance page
   ```

2. **Immediate rollback**:
   ```bash
   npx tsx deployment/scripts/rollback.ts production --force
   ```

3. **Assess damage**:
   - Check application status
   - Verify database integrity
   - Review error logs

#### Database Migration Corruption

1. **Stop application**:
   ```bash
   # Scale down to prevent further damage
   ```

2. **Restore from backup**:
   ```bash
   # Find latest backup
   ls -la *.sql | head -5
   
   # Restore database
   psql $DATABASE_URL < backup-file.sql
   ```

3. **Verify data integrity**:
   ```sql
   -- Run validation queries
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM resumes;
   ```

### Support Contacts

- **Deployment Issues**: DevOps team
- **Database Problems**: Database administrator
- **Application Bugs**: Development team
- **Emergency**: Incident response team

## Security Considerations

### Secrets Management

- Never commit secrets to git
- Use AWS Secrets Manager for production secrets
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use environment variables for configuration

### Access Control

- Limit deployment script access
- Use IAM roles with minimal permissions
- Require MFA for production operations
- Audit deployment activities

### Network Security

- Deploy to private subnets when possible
- Use security groups to restrict access
- Enable VPC flow logs
- Monitor unusual network activity

## Best Practices Summary

‚úÖ **Do**:
- Always test deployments on staging first
- Use dry-run mode for rollbacks
- Monitor health checks closely
- Keep deployment logs
- Communicate changes to team
- Have rollback plan ready
- Backup before database changes

‚ùå **Don't**:
- Deploy directly to production without testing
- Skip health checks
- Ignore warning messages
- Deploy during high-traffic periods
- Make database changes without backups
- Deploy without proper AWS permissions
- Rush emergency fixes without proper testing

**Remember**: When in doubt, rollback and investigate. It's better to be safe than sorry with production deployments.
