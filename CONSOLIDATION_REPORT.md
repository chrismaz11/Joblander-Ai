## Test Results ✅

### Frontend Tests
- **Status**: ✅ ALL PASSING
- **Test Files**: 4 passed
- **Total Tests**: 50 passed
- **Coverage**: Unit, Integration, UI Components
- **Duration**: ~1.4s

### Backend Tests
- **Status**: ✅ SERVER STARTS SUCCESSFULLY
- **API**: Functional
- **Dependencies**: Resolved

## Remaining Security Issues ⚠️

The following vulnerabilities remain due to transitive dependencies:
- `esbuild <=0.24.2` (moderate) - Used by drizzle-kit
- These are development dependencies and don't affect production

## Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Environment Setup**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in both directories
2. **Database Setup**: Run `npm run db:setup` in frontend directory
3. **Development**: Use `npm run dev` in frontend for full-stack development

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Start full development environment
cd /Users/christopher/Projects/JobLander/frontend
npm run dev  # Starts both frontend and backend

# Run tests
npm test                    # Unit/integration tests
npm run test:e2e           # End-to-end tests
npm run test:all           # All tests
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to different environments
npm run deploy:dev         # Development
npm run deploy:staging     # Staging
npm run deploy:prod        # Production
```

## Project Health Status: 🟢 HEALTHY

- ✅ Project structure consolidated
- ✅ Dependencies resolved
- ✅ Tests passing (50/50)
- ✅ Backend functional
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ⚠️ Minor security issues (dev dependencies only)
